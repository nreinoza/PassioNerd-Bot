In contrast, this transdisciplinary course seeks to track and trouble the historical and contemporary creation, dissolution, experiences, and stakes of various ethnoracial borders not just in the US but around the world. We will engage with a range of materials - written texts, films, visual and performance art - to study race and ethnicity through comparative and relational frameworks. Key topics include: empire, neo/colonialism, capital/ism, im/migration, diaspora, caste, liberation, abolition, indigeneity, incarceration, borders, ethnonationalism, solidarity, and resistance. Please note that lectures will be held on Mondays and Wednesdays from 3:30pm to 4:50pm, and a weekly film screening will take place on Fridays from 1:30pm to 4:20pm."

117230,Calculus,MATH 21,4,"This course addresses a variety of topics centered around the theme of &quot;calculus with infinite processes&quot;, largely the content of BC-level AP Calculus that isn&#039;t in the AB-level syllabus. It is needed throughout probability and statistics at all levels, as well as to understand approximation procedures that arise in all quantitative fields (including economics and computer graphics). After an initial review of limit rules, the course goes on to discuss sequences of numbers and of functions, as well as limits &quot;at infinity&quot; for each (needed for any sensible discussion of long-term behavior of a numerical process, such as: iterative procedures and complexity in computer science, dynamic models throughout economics, and repeated trials with data in any field).  Integration is discussed for rational functions (a loose end from Math 20) and especially (improper) integrals for unbounded functions and &quot;to infinity&quot;: this shows up in contexts as diverse as escape velocity for a rocket, the present value of a perpetual yield asset, and important calculations in probability (including the famous &quot;bell curve&quot; and to understand why many statistical tests work as they do).  The course then turns to infinite series (how to &quot;sum&quot; an infinite collection of numbers), some useful convergence and divergence rests for these, and the associated killer app: power series and their properties, as well as Taylor approximations, all of which provide the framework that underlies virtually all mathematical models used in any quantitative field.

The linear algebra portion includes orthogonality, linear independence, matrix algebra, and eigenvalues with applications such as least squares, linear regression, and Markov chains (relevant to population dynamics, molecular chemistry, and PageRank); the singular value decomposition (essential in image compression, topic modeling, and data-intensive work in many fields) is introduced in the final chapter of the e-text. The multivariable calculus portion includes unconstrained optimization via gradients and Hessians (used for energy minimization), constrained optimization (via Lagrange multipliers, crucial in economics), gradient descent and the multivariable Chain Rule (which underlie many machine learning algorithms, such as backpropagation), and Newton&#039;s method (an ingredient in GPS and robotics). The course emphasizes computations alongside an intuitive understanding of key ideas.

122624,Light and Heat,PHYSICS 45,4,"What is temperature? How do the elementary processes of mechanics, which are intrinsically reversible, result in phenomena that are clearly irreversible when applied to a very large number of particles, the ultimate example being life? In thermodynamics, students discover that the approach of classical mechanics is not sufficient to deal with the extremely large number of particles present in a macroscopic amount of gas. The paradigm of thermodynamics leads to a deeper understanding of real-world phenomena such as energy conversion and the performance limits of thermal engines. In optics, students see how a geometrical approach allows the design of optical systems based on reflection and refraction, while the wave nature of light leads to interference phenomena. The two approaches come together in understanding the diffraction limit of microscopes and telescopes. Discussions based on the language of mathematics, particularly calculus. Physical understanding fostered by peer interaction and demonstrations in lecture, and discussion sections based on interactive group problem solving.

The existence of language raises profound questions about the human mind and brain. What do we know when we know a language? How do we translate pressure waves in air into ideas, and vice versa? How can such a complex system be learned so quickly and universally by children? What&iquest;s special about our brains that enables this to happen? What&iquest;s the relationship of language to our broader capacities for thinking and social interaction? This course will introduce you to the ongoing scientific project to tackle these kinds of questions.

226379,How Can We Enforce Good Norms in Inclusive Ways?,PSYCH 285A,3,"Well-functioning groups and spaces are simultaneously inclusive and have clear norms that support people in pursuing goals they value. But often these qualities are in tension. Some spaces are permissive, but lack the norms that help people regulate their behavior. Others enforce norms, but in exclusionary or punitive ways. Are there third ways? How can we create and maintain good norms while being inclusive; respond to people when they violate norms in ways that stand up for the norm but without excluding them? Using classic and contemporary examples, this seminar will explore these questions in diverse contexts, from game theory to responses to interpersonal settings (e.g., couples, families) to institutional settings (e.g., school) to intergroup conflicts (e.g., restorative justice)."

226807,"The New Ecology of Early Childhood: Real World Implications for Policy, Research, and Practice",PSYCH 228,4,"The field of early childhood development is undergoing a profound transformation in the 21st century. Traditional models of child development, while foundational, are increasingly challenged by the complex realities of our rapidly changing world. This course, &quot;The New Ecology of Early Childhood,&quot; is designed to equip graduate students with a comprehensive understanding of an emerging paradigm being formulated at the Stanford Center on Early Childhood (SCEC) that reconceptualizes early childhood development within the context of contemporary global challenges and opportunities. The course is built upon the premise that the ecological systems in which children develop are no longer as clearly delineated as once conceived. Forces that were previously considered distant or indirect now exert immediate and powerful influences on children&#039;s developmental trajectories. And the prevalence of some direct influences (e.g., time spent early care and education environments, residing in extended family households) is increasing. These shifts necessitate a radical rethinking of how we understand, study, and support early childhood development. By offering a comprehensive exploration of this emerging paradigm in early childhood development, this course prepares students to navigate the complex realities of supporting all children thriving in the 21st century. It challenges students to think critically, engage with cutting-edge research, and develop innovative solutions to pressing challenges.

Our focus will be on domestic food policies, though international topics will occasionally be covered. You will learn and practice useful research critique skills, including evaluating threats to causal inference in academic research papers. You will also gain exposure to the policy adoption process and consider how different stakeholders affect this process. Finally, you will gain expertise in identifying and advocating for a policy position in written and oral formats."
226989,Principles of Safety-Critical Autonomy,AA 276,3,"Machine learning has led to tremendous progress in domains such as computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing. Fueled by these advances, machine-learning approaches are now being explored to develop intelligent physical systems that can operate reliably in unpredictable environments. These include not only robotic systems such as autonomous cars and drones but also large-scale transportation and energy systems. However, learning techniques widely used today are extremely data-hungry and lack the necessary mathematical framework to provide guarantees of correctness, causing safety concerns as data-driven physical systems are integrated into our society. This course covers the mathematical foundations of dynamical system safety analysis and modern algorithmic approaches for autonomous decision-making in safety-critical contexts. The focus is on designing safe controllers in the presence of system and environment uncertainty. The course will start with an overview of background material from relevant subfields: control theory and robotics. This will be followed by advanced techniques (reachability analysis, Lyapunov and barrier functions, etc.) in this area. The course will conclude with an overview of recent work in ensuring and updating safety guarantees while learning. Project work as part of the course will provide a flavor of research in this new emerging area. Prerequisite(s): Familiarity with a standard undergraduate engineering mathematics curriculum (CME 100- 106; vector calculus, ordinary differential equations, introductory probability theory) and strong familiarity with linear algebra (e.g., EE 263 or CME 200). Students will ideally have had at least one course in optimization (e.g., EE 364A, CME 307, CS 205L, CS 269O, AA 222) and at least one course in control (e.g., ENGR 205, AA 212). Taking AA203 prior to this course is a huge plus. Students will be assumed to have basic programming skills in Python. If you have questions about the prerequisites, please ask the instructor."
226993,Sustainable Narratives,EARTHSYS 109CSN,3,"This course considers the role creativity plays in addressing ecological collapse. Through the primary lens of ecopoetry and climate fiction, students explore how cultural works document planetary change and reflect our evolving relationships with animals, natural resources, weather, and the concept of &quot;nature.&quot; Can the practice of writing itself change the way we see the world and integrate ideas? Together, we&#039;ll survey how creative expression opens pathways and challenges conventional approaches to scientific knowledge and communication. To quote the visionary bell hooks, &quot;The function of art is to do more than tell it like it is - it&#039;s to imagine what is possible.&quot; We will venture outdoors for inspiration, visit land-based sculptures on campus, and engage with Second Nature: Photography in the Age of the Anthropocene, a temporary exhibit at the Cantor Arts Center. Students will gain a foundation in essential writing techniques while exploring diverse aesthetics and experiential perspectives. They will consider not only the stories they choose to tell but also the significance of the forms and materials they use. Journal prompts - including imitations, guided free-writes, and critical responses- encourage students to experiment with new ways of seeing, imagining, and problem-solving. They will develop three pieces of writing over the course of the quarter, refined with the support of workshop feedback. Students, regardless of major, are encouraged to apply; no prior experience is required."
227009,Design for Microscale Machining and Manufacturing,ME 213,3,"Design course focusing on microscale machining, prototyping, and manufacturing. Students will design, micromachine, and manufacture individual projects. The coursework emphasizes an iterative approach from concept to manufacture. Structured lab experiences build a basic microscale CNC prototyping proficiency. Students with prerequisites listed below may combine micromachined projects with other manufacturing systems. Prerequisites: ME128/318 or consent of instructors; ME325 for students interested in microscale injection molding."
227014,Economics of Voting,ECON 42,5,"The success and fate of democracies around the world rely on citizens&iquest; engagement and participation during elections of government officials: presidents, members of parliaments or councils, governors, attorneys general, judges, sheriffs, etc.&nbsp; Since direct democracies where everyone gathers to discuss and make decisions are costly, inefficient and often simply impossible, representative democracies that pass laws and grant executive authority to elected representatives depend on the wisdom of the electorate to choose effective leaders.&nbsp; This course will focus on one of the most critical duties of citizens in a democracy &iquest; a duty of voting. It will cover principles of voter behavior, common electoral systems, election campaigns and finance, election logistics, referenda, role of media and disinformation, citizenship in the Digital Age, and other election-related topics. The course will use an economic lens to explain observed behavior and election outcomes. The course will also explore various approaches to enact desired change in status quo through voting and elected leaders at local, national and global levels. Taking this course should prepare students to be more effective as citizens, critical thinkers and change makers."
227032,How to Make a Moral Agent,CS 186,3,"Is it bad if you lie to ChatGPT? Who is to blame if ChatGPT lies? Should we let superhuman AI make life and death decisions? These questions ask whether advanced AI systems (today, often large language models - LLMs) can be moral agents - whether they are the kind of thing that can know how to make (ethically) correct decisions, and be held responsible for the rights or wrongs they do. Asking these questions leads us to questions about ourselves: What about us makes us moral agents? Is it our reason? Or is it essential that we emotionally feel each others&#039; pain? Is selfishness irrational, or just unpleasant? Understanding ourselves can help us think about what kinds of artificial minds we would like to make, and, if we can, how. In this class, we provide the philosophical rigor and technical background necessary to robustly interrogate these and related questions. Readings will be drawn from philosophy, deep learning, and the cognitive sciences. The major assessment in this class will be a term project. There will be reading assignments for every class, and a mix of lectures, discussions, and participatory in-class activities. Recommended prerequisites: PHIL 80 or multiple philosophy courses; CS 183."
227082,Participatory Public Memory as an Organizing Strategy,EARTHSYS 120A,3,"This course will engage students in the founding of an on-going interactive public memory project exploring the intersection of history, environmental and climate justice and community action in the Bay Area, in collaboration with the Humanities Action Lab (HAL), based out of Rutgers University. HAL develops collaborative public memory projects about social and environmental justice struggles. Their project, Climates of Inequality: Stories of Environmental Justice is a partnership network of over 20 Universities and Cities in the U.S. and around the world connecting local experiences to build a translocal ecosystem, through art, history, community engagement and activism. As part of Climates of Inequality, local teams work together to activate the histories of frontline communities: those who have long engaged in struggles to eliminate pollution from their communities and have contributed the least to the climate crisis but bear its heaviest burdens. Their multimedia portraits expose the roots of current environmental injustice, and share generations of frontline communities&#039; strategies for resistance, resilience, and mitigation. This initial Climates of Inequality partnership will build the foundation for an ongoing participatory project bringing together community organizations throughout the Bay Area in engaged, interactive work interrogating the historical roots of environmental and climate justice crises and community resistance to injustice.  The course will partner with the Haas Center for Public Service and Environmental Communications in Earth Systems. This is a Cardinal Course designated by the Haas Center for Public Service."
